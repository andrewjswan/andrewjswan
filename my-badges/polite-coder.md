<strong>I am a polite coder.</strong>
<br><br>

I use words like "thanks" and "please" in my issues:

- <a href="https://github.com/RobHofmann/HomeAssistant-GreeClimateComponent/issues/339">#339</a>: Platform `gree` does not generate unique IDs.
- <a href="https://github.com/ORelio/Spotlight-Downloader/issues/40">#40</a>: The image is not updating according to the schedule.
- <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/core/issues/42758">#42758</a>: Gree integration - AC not found
- <a href="https://github.com/home-assistant/operating-system/issues/1389">#1389</a>: Intel NUC - grep: /proc/net/wireless: No such file or directory
- <a href="https://github.com/tomvanswam/compass-card/issues/338">#338</a>: Typo in Russian translation

 And many more...
